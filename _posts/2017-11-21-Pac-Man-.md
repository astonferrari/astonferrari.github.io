PAC MAN

Sprites

Pacman is the sprite that goes round trying to eat the little dots and fruits. 

Blinky tries to stop Pac-Man by eating him.

Pinky tries to stop Pac-Man by eating him.

Clyde tries to stop Pac-Man by eating him.

Inky tries to stop Pac-Man by eating him.

Variables

Every time Pac-Man eats a little dot it adds ten points to your score.                     

If you get eaten by the ghost you lose one of your four lives.

If you eat a flashing dot it will turn the ghost blue so now Pac-Man can try and eat the ghost in ten seconds so he can get two hundred points for each ghost he eats.

Finally for one hundred points you can eat a cherry.
